# Comsys-Hackathon
This is the repository of team Code Crusaders. This contains all the necessary files and folders of Task A and Task B with related documents

We are sharing the google drive link which contains weights of the models used in task A and task B along with their output. For task A
it is reccomended to use the "densenet169_gender_best.keras" file for evaluation and "siamese_best_model.keras" for task B. For task A
one can enter both the directory path along with the weights file or the image to get predicted output. For task B, one can enter the
test data path, for this purpose. Both the models were made on Google Colab and executed using T4-GPU.
